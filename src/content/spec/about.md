# Our Story
At the Somali Economic Growth Forum, we recognize the prevalent discourse among the diaspora expressing a deep desire to return home and effectuate meaningful change. However, we've observed a gap between these aspirations and the actions required to realize them. Determined to bridge this divide, we've embarked on a mission to assemble passionate individuals ready to serve at the forefront of change, collectively channeling their knowledge and resources into tangible initiatives.

​Our journey begins with creating a dynamic forum designed to harness the Somali entrepreneurial spirit. This forum is the cornerstone of our mission, fostering connections and facilitating collaboration. It serves as a central platform for addressing our country’s challenges and enabling the exchange of ideas and strategic insights.​

As we progress, we transition from dialogue to action. Building on the strong foundation of our forum, we introduce a strategic cohort program focused on nurturing innovative startups. This initiative aims to tackle critical issues, generate job opportunities, and promote economic stability.​

We envision a future were returning to our homeland is not merely a dream but a reality, with the diaspora playing a crucial role in positively transforming our communities.
